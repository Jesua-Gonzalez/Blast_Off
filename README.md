~ Developing a python program using OOP principles, class structures and unit tests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have built a space exploration simulation system in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The application models key components of space missions, including astronauts, spacecraft (both crewed and autonomous), and missions themselves. I designed and implemented multiple classes with realistic constraints, interactions, and behavior, and I thoroughly tested the system using Pythonâ€™s unittest module.
